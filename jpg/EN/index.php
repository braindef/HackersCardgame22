<h1>Hackers Cardgame</h1>
<h2>If the System now loops "<font color=tomato class="blink">Your girl is being raped</font>" then you are a targeted individual and under surveillance. If a specific card triggers you also, then it is possible that you must confess first if you did similar things, or satan would like to prevent, that you learn this move, so that he/she can further abuse this move against you. For me as an Autistic i told them that I would commit suicide if they raped me they also know that they would be murderer and they would be in much a worse situation in their Panopticon</b><br><br>

<h2>Never Play <font color=red>Red Team</font> help out with <font color="#77f">Blue Team</font> and save the World</h2>
<br>
Some from the older Generation would like that the young people would become red team, but they still have the biggest surveillance system, so if a young would have success to attack satans network they would pop the legal system and force the young hacker to work for satans black world. So this cards are meant to be some sort of deffence cards to learn from the dirty tricks they use(d) against me.<br><br>

<font class=monospace color=green size=4em><b>If one of the two kids that normally both promise to be true to each other forever breaks the promise, they can easily break your mind but also the mind of the girl or boy you betrayed.

Printing the cards gives you a offline copy, cutting them out makes you focus ~1 Min per card that could be useful for your Learning Curve.

Possibly you would get in serious trouble with those people, that abuses this sort of technology if you would fork this repo <font color=red>*INSERT: "marc is insane"-stimulus on t1 card*</font> but if eg. 1000 <font color=red>*INSERT: "marc has delusions of grandeur"-stimulus on t1 card*</font> would fork at the same time, they would possibly not have enough manpower to target all people that forked it; maybe. Additionally [I] suggest that all people creates their own cards / deck / repo without using the same images or exact the same text of my repository. src1 Card: It would spam the people abusing it *INSERT: <font color=red>against you!!!</font> <font color=yellow>(psychological warfare)</font>* because they would have to keep eg 1000 people in check. Having different decks would make the people that abuses this sort of technolgoy to loose more check-moves *<font color=lightgreen>my insert: some sort of reveres-psychological warfare :D</font>*
<br><br>
If you are crazy enough to <font color=yellow>become a part of mind-control-hacking community</font> take at least 1 equal aged friend, never do such things alone, use as much different technologies as you can, eg. inkscape, illustrator, html5, demoscene videos, painted art, music ... maybe you have even better ideas...
